        <h2>Tests for Web browser supported charset encodings</h2>
        <p>This page loops through all known charset aliases, or labels, from 
        <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">IANA</a> and 
        tests to see whether or not the Web browser supports them.  For each 
        charset alias, a hidden iframe is appended to the document which causes 
        an HTTP request to a PHP page that responds with that alias in the 
        Content-Type header:<p>
  <pre>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-16</pre>
        <p>The iframe element is checked to determine whether or not its 
        contentDocument.charset (or contentDocument.characterSet) property 
        matches the charset alias named in the test case.  A "match" is 
        considered true when either a) the charset names are identical or b) the 
        charset names are not identical but exist in the same alias group 
        together (which means they are simply aliases for one another).  
        If the two match (case-insensitive) then the Web browser supports 
        the encoding and the test is considered a <span
          class="pass">PASS</span>  If the two didn't 
        match it was considered a <span class="fail">FAIL</span> which means
        that the charset label was not supported by the Web browser, or
        perhaps it triggered a fallback to the default encoding, which is
        often UTF-8.  </p>
        <h3>Caveats</h3>
        <p>The test compares alias groupings strictly according to 
        IANA's <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">documented charsets</a>.  
        That is, though "latin5" may be a superset of "windows-1254", the test 
        would report a <span class="fail">fail</span> when such a mapping was 
        returned.  That's because IANA has not listed them as aliases for one 
        another, and rightfully so, after all the mapping tables are quite 
        different between <a href="http://demo.icu-project.org/icu-bin/convexp?conv=ibm-920_P100-1995&s=ALL">latin5</a> 
        and <a href="http://demo.icu-project.org/icu-bin/convexp?conv=ibm-5350_P100-1998&s=ALL">windows-1254</a>, in the range 0x80 to 0x9F.</p>
        <p>However, there also seems to be a problem where two labels should be equivalent 
        but are not because of the above.  E.g. "ISO-8859-6-E" and "ISO-8859-6" will result 
        in a <span class="fail">FAIL</span> because IANA does not list them as equivalent 
        aliases, even though they seem to have <a href="http://demo.icu-project.org/icu-bin/convexp?conv=ibm-1089_P100-1995&s=ALL">identical mappings</a> according to ICU.</p>

        <h3>TODO</h3>
        <p style="text-decoration: line-through">1. Map alias groups together so they 
        don't "fail" when they actually just map to an alternative alias e.g. when 
        test case label "greek" results in the Web browser returning a "iso-8859-7" 
        it should be noted as an alternative alias and the test should "pass".</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: line-through">2. Optionally hide all failures that 
        fallback to UTF-8</p>
        <p>3. Seems to be a few false positives because of the caveats mentioned above - replace 
        or augment the alias groupings from IANA with those groupings from the ICU project

        <h3>Start the testing...</h3>
        <p>Either type in a charset alias to run a single test, or run a test
        of all charset aliases.  Results will be listed in either the PASS or
        FAIL column and displayed with the following format:</p>
        <pre>test_case, frame_charset</pre>
        <p>Where 'test_case' is the charset alias name used in testing, and
        'frame_charset' was the charset encoding that the Web browser
        ended up interpreting the document iframe as.  For example, 
        <span class="pass" id="pass">iso-ir-144 <span class="framecharset">,
            ISO-8859-5</span></span> means that the test case used 'iso-ir-144'
        and the Web browser interpreted that as 'ISO-8859-5'.  Since the two
        labels are aliases for one another, this indicates a test that passed.
        If it failed, it would indicate that the Web browser either used a
        fallback encoding to interpret the text, or that it threw an
        error.</p>

        <span id="teststatus"></span>
        <br>
        <input type="checkbox" value="false" name="showFallback" id="cb" /> 
        Hide results that fallback to UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 (gets rid of potentially uninteresting results)
